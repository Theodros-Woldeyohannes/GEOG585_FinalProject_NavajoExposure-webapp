    <h3>Interactive Map of Potential Exposure to Abandoned Uranium Mines (AUMs) in Navajo Nation</h3>
    
    <p>Residents of Navajo Nation (Dine Bikeyah), a sovereign Indigenous Tribal nation of the American
        Southwest, are vulnerable to environmental pollution from various sources such as resource
        extraction and unregulated solid waste disposal (Kirkemeno et al. 1998; Ong et al. 2014; Lewis et
        al. 2017). For example, from the 1940s through the 1980s, one of the most sought-after resources
        was uranium, as evident by the hundreds of abandoned uranium mines (AUMs) across Navajo
        lands. This legacy of mining and continuing presence of AUMs has caused significant
        environmental contamination in Navajo Nation (Eichstaedt 1994; Masco 2013; Voyles 2015;
        Lewis et al. 2017). As a result, understanding the distribution of potential exposure to these AUMs
        is a significant concern in Navajo communities. Some recent work to model this exposure potential
        includes a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) (Malczewski 2006) model developed by Lin
        et al. (2020) to analyze and understand potential exposure within Navajo Nation.</p>

    <p>The MCDA model predicts potential exposure based on several environmental criteria (wind,
        topography, hydrology, etc.) represented as raster surfaces, in which cells contain an index value
        indicating this potentiality on a normalized scale of 0-1. The final model output is a weighted linear
        combination (WLC) of the individual criteria. This final output represents cumulative potential for
        exposure from the above-described environmental criteria (Lin et al. 2020).</p>

    <p>Critical layers were created following methodology by Lin et al. (2020). Critical layers were
        generated using the following data-sources: abandoned uranium mine point data sourced from the
        U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) (U.S. EPA 2007); meteorological data sourced
        from the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) model (NOAA 2020); a 30-m digital
        elevation model (DEM) sourced from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) (U.S. Geological
        Survey n.d.); road networks sourced from the U.S. Census Bureau (U.S. Census Bureau n.d.);
        downslope drainage and ground water sample data sourced from USEPA and the University of
        New Mexico (U.S. EPA 2007; Hoover et al. 2017) (U.S. EPA 2007; Hoover et al. 2017); and
        vegetation data from the NASA Vegetation Index and Phenology (VIP) global dataset (Didan
        2010). The critical layers (represented as raster datasets) are as follows:</p>

    <p>- Proximity to AUM sites</p>
    <p>- Proximity to roads</p>
    <p>- Proximity to downslope drainages from AUM sites</p>
    <p>- Topographic landforms</p>
    <p>- Wind index</p>
    <p>- Topographic Wind Exposure (TWE)</p>
    <p>- Vegetation Robustness (NDVI)</p>
    <p>- Groundwater contamination</p>

    <p>This map displays an interactive version of the combined predicted exposure, including mine locations.</p>
